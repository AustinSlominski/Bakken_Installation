## Social Media Data

I am currently using a PHP script to obtain streams from Twitter. This was originally something I came across in a repository I found [here](https://github.com/tkzic/internet-sensors) (containing some code from [Mike Pultz](https://mikepultz.com/2013/06/mining-twitter-api-v1-1-streams-from-php-with-oauth/)). This is for Max/MSP API connections using OSC, which provides an easy, flexible communication with both openframeworks and Max.
